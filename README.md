👋 Hi there! I'm Suhani, a passionate Health Informatics graduate student at Michigan Technological University. With a background in Pharmacy and experience as a medical scribe handling Epic EHR, I'm eager to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology.

🔍 I believe that healthcare professionals can leverage technology to make a significant impact. Aspire to become a Health Data Analyst, blending my clinical knowledge with technical skills.

📸 Outside of the digital world, you'll often find me behind the lens capturing moments through photography or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

👁️ As a silent observer, I tend to observe things keenly, gathering insights and understanding subtleties.

Excited about delving into informatics tools for addressing high-risk diseases and keen to team up on relevant projects.
